 This application is developed and tested on UBUNTU(16.04 LTS) as part of Blockchain Hackathon conducted by Blockchain Council.Open Source references are taken inorder to  develop this application on top of Tuna-app.
 
Requirements :

4.Make sure you have Docker running on your machine before you run the next command.First, remove any pre-existing containers, as it may conflict with commands.
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

5.Then, letâ€™s start the Hyperledger Fabric network with the following command:
$ ./startFabric.sh

Troubleshooting: If, after running the above you are getting an error similar to the following:

ERROR: failed to register layer: rename
/var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/layerdb/tmp/write-set-091347846 /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/layerdb/sha256/9d3227c1793b7494e598caafd0a5013900e17dcdf1d7bdd31d39c82be04fcf28: file exists
